Lord Vance is slain during the fight and Lord Piper retreats back to Riverrun with the remnants of his forces, with Jaime following on his heels. Meanwhile, Tywin brings another Lannister army up from the south. The rout of the rivermen beneath the Golden Tooth allows Jaime to then fight the battle under the walls of Riverrun. Ser Marq Piper and Karyl Vance, now a lord, raid behind the Lannisters' lines.

They make a fighting retreat only to be taken in the rear by Gregor Clegane and his men. Lothar Mallery, Gladden Wylde and Raymun Darry are all killed, as are most of Lord Eddard's men. Beric is killed as well by the Mountain's lance. Young Lord Edric Dayne, participating as Beric's squire, pulls him out of the Red Fork and stands over the body while the battle rages around them. Alyn of Winterfell manages to rally the survivors into a retreat. Meanwhile, Thoros reflexively says the words of his faith that restores Beric to life. At Moat Cailin, Robb Stark tells his mother, Catelyn Tully, that the Lannisters have won victories at the Golden Tooth and the Mummer's Ford, and that Lord Tywin Lannister has closed off the kingsroad and is marching north towards Harrenhal. However, the survivors of Beric's company form the core of the brotherhood without banners. Later at the crossroads inn, after hearing of the Whispering Wood and the Battle of the Camps, Tywin tells Tyrion and Kevan Lannister that Thoros of Myr and Beric Dondarrion continue to plague their foraging parties.

Securing a victory, Jaime puts the river lords to rout. Edmure and many of his knights and bannermen are taken captive. Lord Tytos Blackwood manages to lead some of the surviving men back within Riverrun, where Jaime places them under siege. In the meantime Tywin leads a second, larger Lannister army against the companies of men Edmure had dispersed along his borders to guard against Ser Gregor Clegane's raiding. Tywin and Ser Kevan Lannister are able to destroy them piecemeal before they can regroup. They then seize many prominent castles in the riverlands, most notably Harrenhal, which is yielded without a fight. They assume a position at the ruby ford, where they can both block any Stark or Arryn attempt to relieve Riverrun and maintain contact with King's Landing.
Battle of the Green Fork;298;4;Robb Stark;Joffrey/Tommen Baratheon;Stark;;;;Lannister;;;;loss;pitched battle;1;1;18000;20000;Roose Bolton, Wylis Manderly, Medger Cerwyn, Harrion Karstark, Halys Hornwood;Tywin Lannister, Gregor Clegane, Kevan Lannister, Addam Marbrand;1;Green Fork;10.196;16.70471;The Riverlands;The Stark army, commanded by Lord Roose Bolton, marches throughout the night in an effort to take the Lannister army by surprise. They arrive in the early morning and launch their attack. Tyrion Lannister observes the banners of Houses Hornwood, Karstark, Cerwyn, Glover, Frey, and Stark. However, the Lannister army arrays itself in time to meet the northmen. The westermen's order of battle includes: The center: Ser Kevan Lannister commands 10,000 men, with Lords Lefford, Lydden and Serrett at his side with 300 heavy horse. The rest of the center is a mixed infantry force including pikemen, archers, axemen, swordsmen, and spearmen. The right: Ser Addam Marbrand commands 4,000 knights and other heavy lancers, among them Ser Flement Brax and members of Houses Crakehall and Swyft. The left/van: Ser Gregor Clegane commanding. At 1,000 men, the vanguard is entirely mounted, but consists of Tyrion and his clansmen, freeriders, sellswords, and raw fieldhands and smallfolk from Lannisport. The reserve: Personally commanded by Lord Tywin Lannister. 5,000 men, half mounted, half afoot. Tywin places his undisciplined men on the left to tempt the Stark commander, whom Tywin believes is the untested Robb Stark, to overcommit there. Tywin hopes the Lannister van will rout and the Starks will plunge into the gap, eager to flank him. Tywin then intends for Kevan and the center to wheel to the left and take the northerners in the flank. Perhaps owing to the northerners' exhaustion following their night march, the Lannister van, led by Gregor, defeats the forces arrayed in front of it. Fighting in the van, Tyrion hides beneath his shield when arrows fall on northmen and westermen alike. Kevan then brings up the center in support of the left, and pushes the Stark lines against the hills behind them. Tywin leads his reserve behind the van, along the river, to break the remnants of the Stark line. The Stark forces are routed and flee to the mouth of the causeway where Roose reforms them. Although Roose Bolton is defeated, his march down the Green Fork, prior to the battle, distracts the Lannister army long enough to give Robb Stark the chance to fall upon Ser Jaime Lannister'sorce unmolested in the battle in the Whispering Wood. Roose's host loses several thousand men in the battle. Roose, Robett Glover, Ronnel Stout, Ser Kyle Condon, Ser Aenys Frey, Elmar Frey and the remainder of the army are able to escape because Lord Tywin Lannister, on account of his desire to help Jaime, fails to give chase. During the battle, Lord Halys Hornwood and Ser Pate of the Blue Fork are killed. Lord Medger Cerwyn is captured and dies later at Harrenhal from a wound taken in the fighting. Other captives taken are Harrion Karstark, Ser Wylis Manderly, Ser Donnel Locke, Ser Jared Frey, Ser Hosteen Frey, Ser Danwell Frey, and Ronel Rivers.[6] The deaths of Lord Hornwood at the Green Fork and his son Daryn in the Whispering Wood cause a succession crisis to Hornwood. Tyrion leaves a captured northern knight in the care of Bronn. Two of Tyrion's clan leaders, Conn and Ulf son of Umar, are among the slain.
Battle of the Whispering Wood;298;5;Robb Stark;Joffrey/Tommen Baratheon;Stark;Tully;;;Lannister;;;;win;ambush;1;1;1875;6000;Robb Stark, Brynden Tully;Jaime Lannister;1;Whispering Wood;9.63325;10.51392;The Riverlands;Robb sends Brynden with a few hundred men carrying Tully banners to raid and draw Jaime from his camp at Riverrun. Expecting to crush a small force, Jaime and most of his cavalry are lured north of the Tumblestone to a forested valley where the rest of Robb's men are hidden. Lady Maege Mormont and Lord Jason Mallister wait east of the valley, while Lord Rickard Karstark is to the north. West is Ser Stevron Frey, and across a far ridge Lord Greatjon Umber. Robb's mother, Lady Catelyn Stark, waits high on a ridge under the protection of Hallis Mollen. Once all of Jaime's unsuspecting men have entered the valley, the Mormonts sound horns to signal the moonlit trap has been sprung, followed by Umbers, Mallisters, Freys, and Karstarks. Jaime's horsemen are attacked by bowmen hidden in the trees by Robb, and the Young Wolf and northern bannermen lead their own cavalry against the ambushed westermen. Robb is joined in the fighting by his direwolf, Grey Wind. When Jaime sees the battle is lost, he rallies his retainers and attempts to cut his way through the host to slay Robb in single combat. He is halted, but not before slaying Daryn Hornwood, Eddard Karstark and Torrhen Karstark of Robb's personal guard. Grey Wind howls as dawn breaks and the fighting winds down. According to Theon Greyjoy, the Lannisters lose ten men for every one of Robb's that falls. Jaime is captured, along with near a hundred knights and a dozen lords bannermen including: Lord Gawen Westerling, Lord Quenten Banefort, Ser Garth Greenfield, Lord Regenard Estren, Ser Tytos Brax, Mallor the Dornishman, Willem Lannister, and the Lannister cousins Cleos Frey and Tion Frey. The capture of Jaime leaves the Lannister army surrounding Riverrun leaderless, leading directly to its disintegration at the Battle of the Camps and leaving Lord Tywin Lannister and Queen Cersei Lannister despondent. Having Jaime as a hostage, and recognizing his value as a prisoner, the Starks gain enormous bargaining power. The deaths of Eddard and Torrhen Karstark by Jaime's hand plant a seed of vengeance in the heart of their father, Lord Rickard Karstark, however. Gawen is taken to Seagard, Quenten to Stone Hedge, Garth to Raventree Hall, and Regenard and Tytos to the Twins. Willem, Cleos, and Tion are held hostage at Riverrun.

His force clears palisades and finishes off any remaining scouts. The sleeping, leaderless camp is overrun. Men from the other camps, roused by the noise, soon attempt to come to the aid of the camp under attack. Lord Andros Brax leads his men to the rafts and attempts to make a crossing. Riverrun begins pelting the rafts with thrown rocks, and soon the rafts are flipping and sinking. Among those killed on the rafts is Lord Brax. The camp between the rivers is overrun too, this time by men led by Robb Stark, Lord Jon Umber, and members of House Mallister coming in from the west. The Lannister force attempts to form a shieldwall, but are taken in the rear by a sortie from Riverrun led by Lord Tytos Blackwood. Lord Umber fires the siege towers and Lord Blackwood releases the prisoners taken in the earlier battle under the walls of Riverrun. The southern camp of the Lannister force, 2,000 spears and 2,000 bowmen under the command of Ser Forley Prester, is left unmolested and retreats in good order back to the Golden Tooth. The Tyroshi sellsword who leads Forley's freeriders strikes his banners and switches sides, however.

Ser Gregor Clegane descends on the castle, taking it quickly and putting all the defenders to the sword, including the eight-year-old Lord Lyman. Gregor leaves a garrison of Lannister soldiers. Ser Gregor, having killed Ser Raymun Darry at the Mummer's Ford, and the young Lord Lyman at Darry, is responsible for the downfall one of the major houses of the riverlands. Lord Lyman was the last male heir of the Darry line. Later in the war, Darry falls to northern forces after a brief siege. Ser Helman Tallhart receives orders from Lord Roose Bolton to put the Lannister garrison to the sword and torch the castle in the name of Robb Stark.

The Victarion-led ironborn seize the ruined fortifications, which are held by a small northern force of mostly archers. Other captains with Victarion include Red Ralf Stonehouse, Ralf Kenning, and Ralf the Limper. After harrying the Stony Shore, Theon changes Balon's plan and captures Winterfell. The news of the seizures of Winterfell and Moat Cailin changes Robb's plans and forces him to return to the north. Moat Cailin is eventually besieged by northmen after Victarion brings most of his men back to the Iron Islands for the kingsmoot.

Asha Greyjoy takes thirty longships of picked men and sails north around Sea Dragon Point. She lands on the tidal flats to the north of Deepwood and seizes the castle after a moon's turn with a thousand ironborn. Asha takes hostage Robett's family, including Lady Sybelle Glover and her children, Gawen and Erena, as well Larence Snow, the Bastard of Hornwood. Rather than follow Balon's instructions to continue raiding the Stony Shore, Theon instead seizes Winterfell in an effort to compete with Asha. Having few men to hold the large castle, Theon has Stygg ride to Deepwood to request aid from Asha. She visits Theon at Winterfell, but he refuses to give up his new seat and Asha leaves him only with ten reinforcements. All ten abandon Theon when Ser Rodrik Cassel approaches the castle, and Theon is soon captured by House Bolton during the sack of Winterfell. After the Battle of the Blackwater, Lord Roose Bolton orders Robett Glover to attack Duskendale. Following the defeat at Duskendale, Roose tells Robb Stark that Robett attacked out of grief and fear for the fall of Deepwood. Deepwood is eventually retaken by King Stannis Baratheon, during which Asha is taken prisoner.

Expecting no trouble from the ironmen, Benfred and his party approach the Stony Shore without scouts, singing and talking loudly. In a crook of a road, the ironborn fall on the party, first loosing a flight of arrows from concealed positions. Theon leads the men-at-arms into hand-to-hand combat and massacres the northerners. The captured Benfred refuses to answer questions and insults the Drowned God within Aeron Greyjoy's hearing. He is put to death on Theon's command, being drowned by Aeron and his followers. Theon mortally wounds one of his ironborn, Todric, after the drunken man squabbles over loot. After defeating the Wild Hares, Theon gives six of his eight longships to Aeron so he can continue harrying the coast, while the crew of Theon's Sea Bitch and Dagmer's Foamdrinker advance inland. By killing Benfred's party, the true size of the assault by the ironmen is kept secret a little longer, which allows the taking of Deepwood Motte and an attack on Torrhen's Square.

Rodrik leads the gathered northmen to victory. The ironborn are not disciplined enough to stand a charge by mounted horsemen and their shield wall breaks. Dagmer leads the remnants of his force back to the Stony Shore. With Winterfell's levies away at Torrhen's Square, Theon Greyjoy is able to capture the undefended Winterfell. After defeating Dagmer's attack on Torrhen's Square, Rodrik redirects his levies to retake Winterfell from Theon and his ironborn. However, Ramsay Snow and the Boltons betray Rodrik's army in a battle at Winterfell, during which Leobald, Rodrik, and Cley are slain. Dagmer then returns to Torrhen's Square and is able to capture the lightly-defended castle.

Rodrik demands the ironborn surrender Winterfell, and he promises safe passage for all who were not involved in the murder of children. Theon counters by having a noose put around the neck of Rodrik's daughter, Beth Cassel, and promises to hang her at dusk if he does not retreat, and he will continue to hang hostages at every dawn and dusk until they leave. The parley accomplishes nothing other than terms being given. Later as the sun sets, a force of roughly 600 Boltons from the Dreadfort arrives and meets Rodrik's Stark army. Believing the Dreadfort men to be reinforcements, Rodrik offers his hand in greeting to their helmeted leader. However, the man takes Rodrik's arm off at the elbow and reveals his identity as that of Ramsay Snow, the Bastard of Lord Bolton. Rodrik thought he had previously killed Ramsay for his crimes against House Hornwood, but Ramsay had actually switched clothing with his now-deceased serving man, Reek. Although outnumbered, the Bolton force under Ramsay attacks the Stark army, leading to fighting in the streets of the winter town. From atop Winterfell's battlements, Theon, Maester Luwin, and Black Lorren watch the Dreadfort men repeatedly wheel and charge the Stark soldiers, preventing them from forming up between the town's burning houses. Cley Cerwyn is killed by an arrow to the eye, and Leobald Tallhart dies as well. While the Stark army is routed and dispersed, Ramsay loses only twenty or thirty of the Dreadfort men. As the battle winds down, Theon admits Ramsay into Winterfell, and Theon recognizes him as ""Reek"", who had brought back the Dreadfort's garrison, although Rodrik had slain Reek-disguised-as-Ramsay in the Hornwood. The Bolton men cut down the ironmen, sack the castle, and attack its servants, such as Maester Luwin. Although the battle at Winterfell is not especially bloody, the hold of House Stark on the north is shattered. Most of Ser Rodrik Cassel's leaders are killed, but a good many of his common soldiers escape and return to their villages and holdfasts. However, their accounts of what happened vary. According to Ramsay Snow, Theon Greyjoy cut down Rodrik during a parley. At the Twins prior to the Red Wedding, Lord Roose Bolton tells Robb Stark, the King in the North, that his son Ramsay successfully rallied the northmen after Theon's ironmen cut down Rodrik and Leobald Tallhart. Wex Pyke indicates to Lord Wyman Manderly and Robett Glover that Ramsay's claims are false. After the fight by Deepwood Motte, Stannis Baratheon's army is joined by Cerwyns, Hornwoods, and Tallharts who survived the battle outside the gates of Winterfell."

Their leader, whom Theon Greyjoy dubs ""Red Helm"" because of his fine armor, has the bodies of Rodrik Cassel, Cley Cerwyn, and Leobald Tallhart dropped. Theon then allows the Dreadfort men to pass Winterfell's moat and inner gate. Theon recognizes Red Helm to be Reek when he removes his helm, but he is actually Ramsay Snow, the Bastard of Bolton. When Theon balks at relinquishing his bedwarmer Kyra, Ramsay strikes Theon and the Bolton men begin to kill the ironborn, including Red Rolfe, Kenned, and Ulf the Ill, although Black Lorren is able to kill a few Boltons before he too falls. Maester Luwin is speared and ridden over. Ramsay orders his men to spare the wards from House Frey, Big Walder and Little Walder, and orders his men to burn Winterfell. Unbeknownst to Theon and Ramsay, hiding in the crypts of Winterfell are Bran and Rickon Stark, Meera and Jojen Reed, Hodor, and Osha. The direwolves Summer and Shaggydog, who are outside of Winterfell, smell the blood and burnt flesh from the battle and ensuing sack, and they hear the Boltons attack the defenseless people of Winterfell and burn its buildings. The next morning the direwolves find only wild dogs, dead bodies, and dying horses amidst the burning winter town. When Bran and his companions leave Winterfell's crypt that morning, they find that one side of the First Keep has fallen away and its interior is burnt. Winterfell's previously broken tower remains standing, however. After being joined by Summer and Shaggydog, they reconnoiter Winterfell. Its granite walls still stand, though somewhat blackened by fire, but the interior is heavily damaged. The Great Hall's roof has collapsed, fires are visible in its cellar and a storehouse, and the glass gardens are destroyed. The stables have burned along with the horses, such as Dancer and Smiler, while most of the hounds were slain in the kennels. Water from Winterfell's hot springs leaks from the Library Tower. The bridge between the Bell Tower and the rookery has collapsed, while Luwin's turret is destroyed. The sept built by Lord Eddard Stark for Lady Catelyn Tully is burned. The iron portcullis at the Hunter's Gate has been warped by heat. They find Luwin dying in the godswood, which is mostly unscathed. The group separates after Osha gives Luwin the gift of mercy. As Bran leaves Winterfell, he believes that the castle will survive despite the destruction."

Stafford trains the inexperienced recruits near the village of Oxcross, within three days ride from Lannisport. Thinking himself safe in his own lands, Stafford does not bother to set sentries. During the night, Robb sends men to cut the lines that hold Stafford's horses. When Robb sets loose Grey Wind, the horses are maddened by the scent and trample tents and men alike while trying to flee. With confusion sending Lannister men fleeing everywhere, Robb sends his own cavalry. The battle is more a rout then a real encounter, as the untrained and surprised Lannister army fail to put up much resistance. Stafford is slain by Lord Rickard Karstark while running after his horse. Ser Stevron Frey, Lord Walder Frey's eldest son and heir, suffers a minor wound during the battle, but dies shortly thereafter. Among those reported dead, missing and wounded are Ser Lymond Vikary, Lord Roland Crakehall, and Lord Antario Jast. These men are actually captured by the Stark forces, along with Martyn Lannister, Lord Jast's sons, and half a hundred other highborn hostages.

Renly is at Bitterbridge with his army when the news reaches his camp. He splits his forces and rides with some twenty thousand cavalry to Storm's End to break the siege. He confronts Stannis during a parlay, with Lady Catelyn Stark in attendance, during which he offers Stannis a peach, but the two brothers are unable to set aside their differences. Neither will yield; Instead, they agree that a battle is set to start at dawn the next day. However, shortly before the battle is to start, while being armored for battle by Brienne of Tarth, Renly is killed by a shadow assassin summoned by Melisandre. Ser Emmon Cuy and Ser Robar Royce, who had been guarding the king's tent, accuse Brienne of the murder when they see Renly dead in Brienne's arms. Catelyn Stark, who had witnessed Renly's death, convinces Ser Robar that Brienne is innocent. Escaping Ser Emmon, Catelyn and Brienne flee the camp and head for the riverlands. A raging Ser Loras Tyrell later kills Ser Emmon Cuy and Ser Robar Royce for failing to protect their king. Melisandre of Asshai births a shadow baby. With Renly dead, the majority of the host that had accompanied him to Storm's End swears their allegiance to Stannis. House Florent and both branches of House Fossoway also defect to Stannis, but a fifth of Renly's knights returns to Bitterbridge with Ser Loras Tyrell. First to join Stannis is Lord Alester Florent, the uncle of Stannis's queen, Selyse. The siege continues as Storm's End's castellan, Ser Cortnay Penrose, refuses to yield the castle to Stannis because he fears for the safety of King Robert I's bastard son Edric Storm. During a parley beneath the walls, Cortnay offers single combat with a champion of Stannis's choosing, but is rebuffed by the king. In order to coerce Ser Cortnay, several ideas are proposed, among them storming the castle, leaving a force to mount a protracted siege, or threatening to kill Cortnay's father, Lord Penrose. Stannis refuses all of these suggestions. Instead, he turns to Davos Seaworth. To end the siege quickly, Davos smuggles Melisandre under the castle by boat, where he witnesses her giving birth to another shadow, who assassinates Cortnay. Although it is said that Cortnay threw himself from a tower, Varys, the master of whisperers from Joffrey's small council, correctly points out that Cortnay had not seemed lost to despair. Lord Elwood Meadows, who becomes castellan after Cortnay, surrenders the castle to Stannis."

Lord Jason Mallister was commanded with the defense of four fords, while Lord Karyl Vance commanded the defense of fords to the north of Riverrun. The west bank of the Red Fork is higher than the east and wooded. The defenders used those trees to hide archers and placed scorpions as support. Ser Edmure kept his best knights as a reserve, to ride where they were needed most. Initially Lord Tywin probed the defenses, attempting to find an unguarded ford. Ser Flement Brax was sent south to attempt a breach there, and there was also fighting to the north of Riverrun. After two days of skirmishing, Lord Tywin attempted to force a crossing in a dozen places. The most heated battle was at Stone Mill, where Edmure faces Gregor Clegane. Although Clegane and his men managed to gain the west bank, they suffered terrible losses. Edmure turned back Clegane and his men with his reserve. Clegane is wounded by a dozen arrows. Elsewhere, Ser Addam Marbrand was thrown back three times, Lord Leo Lefford drowned, Robert Brax is killed, and Ser Lyle Crakehall is taken captive. Unable to cross the river, Tywin is forced to retreat. At the end of the day, Tywin's army was seen marching south-east.

The incognito Arya Stark, seeing an opportunity, blackmails Jaqen H'ghar into helping her free the northern prisoners in the Widow's Tower, and Jaqen enlists the aid of Rorge and Biter. Under the pretense of bringing onion soup to a group of Amory's guards, the four kill the guards and free the northern prisoners. Unknown to Ser Amory Lorch and independently of Arya and Jaqen, Vargo Hoat had previously approached Roose's encampment and struck a deal to turn over the castle to the Starks. While the freed northmen and rivermen are escaping, the Brave Companions simultaneously turn on their former Lannister allies, killing them in their beds or while they are celebrating in the Barracks Hall.

After hearing of the supposed deaths at Winterfell of his brothers, Bran and Rickon, Robb deflowers Jeyne, and, to spare her dishonor, marries her shortly thereafter. As a consequence of that the Westerlings join with House Stark. However, by marrying Jeyne, Robb breaks his alliance with House Frey.

They enter visual range of the city in the late afternoon. Confident of his superior numbers, and knowing that the fleet of King's Landing cannot hope to contest them, Ser Imry does not send scouts ahead, and attacks immediately, leaving the Lysene galleys of Salladhor Saan as rearguard out in Blackwater Bay. The fleet is organized into ten battle lines composed of twenty ships each. The first three lines are made up of war galleys belonging to the royal navy and the lords of the narrow sea. Behind them sails the smaller Myrish contingent, who are to land troops to attack the city, before joining the first three lines in battle. The smaller and slower sailed ships are to ferry Stannis's host. Ser Davos Seaworth realizes that the two watchtowers at the mouth of the Blackwater Rush are newly build, and he notices the chain in the water. The fleet continues forward nonetheless. From within the city, pots of pitch are flung at the ships, and the trebuchets located within the city start to fling stones. Tyrion Lannister has ordered several of Joffrey's ships to be filled with wildfire. Stannis' fleet is lured further in the bay when Joffrey's pull back. When they engage the fleet of King's Landing, the ships and the river are soon afire. The wildfire destroys nearly every ship in both fleets. To their horror, the men on Stannis' ship discover that the great chain has been raised behind them, cutting off their retreat.[8] However, as Ser Imry's first two battle lines had been well upstream of the fire when the hulks went up, some thirty or forty galleys are able to escape the inferno at first. Eight ships manage to land under the city walls and put men ashore, while many of the Myrmen escape the flames by sailing for the south bank. The city itself is defended by some five thousand seven hundred gold cloaks,[N 7] leavened with eight hundred mercenaries and three hundred knights, squires, and men-at-arms from the court and the surrounding crownlands. As acting Hand of the King, command of the defense is taken by Tyrion Lannister. At the start of the battle, some small skirmishes arise within the city when some drunkards in Flea Bottom smash doors and climb into houses. Lord Jacelyn Bywater sends his gold cloaks to deal with them. When rich merchants and such gather in the square before the Red Keep, asking for refuge in the castle, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister commands the gates be kept close. Tyrion tasks several groups of mounted men-at-arms, along with what few knights the city has, to harry Stannis's forces as they come ashore. Under the command of Sandor Clegane and Ser Balon Swann of the Kingsguard, they manage to help stem the tide, but as the battle drags on, they suffer grievous casualties. Tyrion and King Joffrey I Baratheon look on from the Mud Gate how the fleet goes up in flames. After King Joffrey leaves to shoot the Antler Men from the trebuchets, guarded by Ser Meryn Trant and Ser Osmund Kettleblack, Tyrion learns of Stannis' men having landed on the tourney grounds, who are preparing to ram the King's Gate. He arrives at the Mud Gate where Sandor Clegane, who had already led three sorties in which he has lost half his men, refuses to go out again. The wildfire raging across the river has robbed Clegane of his courage, and his refusal to lead any more sorties threatens to break the morale of the defenders. As they need to hold the river at all costs, Tyrion decides to lead the next sortie himself. Shamed into action by the dwarf's display of courage, several defenders gather to Tyrion's side. While Tyrion is leading the sortie at the King's Gate, the Mud Gate falls under attack as well. Queen Regent Cersei Lannister orders King Joffrey, who is still at the trebuchets near the gate, to be brought back to the castle. When the defenders see their king retire, their morale breaks and they begin throwing down their spears and flee by the hundreds, leaving the walls and killing their officers, including Ser Jacelyn Bywater, in the process. Tyrion manages to disperse the attackers at the King's Gate and makes for the Mud Gate. When Ser Balon Swann points out that the galleys on the river which had smashed into each other have tangled together, creating a bridge of ships, which is being used by Stannis' boldest knights to cross the river, they take the fight to the riverfront. Tyrion eventually finds himself on the bridge of ships, when it is about to collapse. He is severely wounded by Ser Mandon Moore of the Kingsguard, who had been Tyrion's sworn shield throughout the battle. Moore is killed by Tyrion's squire, Podrick Payne. With the bridge breaking up and their Hand lost in battle, the defenders retreat within the city walls. At this point, after only a few hours of resistance, the battle seems to be lost to Tyrion, though at this time he also sees Stannis's army seemingly fighting itself on the other side of the river.

Darry is once again free of Lannister occupation. At Harrenhal, Lord Roose Bolton sends word to Ser Helman to put the castle to the torch and the Lannister captives to the sword in the name of King Robb Stark. Helman is to then join forces with Robett Glover and attack Duskendale. Following the Battle of the Blackwater, the Iron Throne grants Darry to Ser Lancel Lannister. At the end of the War of the Five Kings, the Lannisters claim the Darry lands and marry Lancel to Amerei Frey, the daughter of Mariya Darry.

Performed songs include ""Alysanne"", ""Flowers of Spring"", ""Iron Lances"", and ""The Queen Took Off Her Sandal, the King Took Off His Crown"". A drunken Greatjon Umber bellows ""The Bear and the Maiden Fair"". Robb dances with Roslin, several other Freys, and Dacey Mormont. Several poor dishes are served, the most appetizing being pink lamb. Roose toasts Walder's grandsons, Big Walder and Little Walder, who are in the care of Roose's son, Ramsay Snow, after the sack of Winterfell. As part of the bedding custom, Edmure and Roslin depart the hall in the company of many guests of the opposite gender. By using sellswords and knights at the feast disguised as musicians, and getting Robb's men too drunk to fight, Lord Walder Frey is able to coordinate a massacre with little loss to his own men. While the unknowing Edmure beds Roslin, the twin castles and the outlying camp are signalled when the band in Walder's hall begins playing ""The Rains of Castamere"". Few of the northmen in the hall have a chance to react, and most are butchered on the spot by the musicians' crossbows or Frey knives. Ser Ryman Frey leads Frey men-at-arms with longaxes. Mailed northmen in shaggy fur cloaks—Boltons and possibly Karstarks—join the Freys, and the betrayers kill many of Robb Stark's personal guard, including Smalljon Umber, Dacey Mormont, and Ser Wendel Manderly. Roose slays Robb, who was previously shot by arrows, with a thrust to the heart while stating that ""Jaime Lannister sends his regards.""Catelyn uses a knife to saw the neck of Lord Walder's grandson, the fool Jinglebell, after which Ser Raymund Frey slits Catelyn's throat. While the Starks are being slaughtered in the hall, the unknowing Edmure impregnates Roslin in a bedchamber.  Some guests who had accompanied them, such as the Greatjon, Patrek Mallister, and Ser Marq Piper, are overwhelmed and taken captive. Freys kill Grey Wind in the yard with crossbow quarrels, despite Ser Raynald Westerling's attempt to save the direwolf. In the camp outside the eastern castle, the three specially-rigged feast tents collapse and are set aflame with fire arrows during the slaughter, having been oiled earlier. While drunken northmen burn inside the tents, Bastard Walder Rivers leads armored Frey men-at-arms against Robb's men outside of the tents. Sandor defends Arya against three men, including Ser Garse Goodbrook and Ser Tytos Frey, and the Hound escapes with Arya after knocking the girl unconscious. Though no definitive count is known, most of Robb's men are killed or captured, while House Frey loses approximately fifty men in the camps. After the battle, the Freys hack and mutilate Robb's body and cut off his head along with that of Grey Wind. In a mockery of Robb's relationship with his direwolf, the Freys sew Grey Wind's head onto Robb's decapitated body and nail a crown atop the direwolf's head. Robb's bronze and iron crown is kept by Ryman Frey. Catelyn is thrown naked into the river in a mockery of House Tully funeral customs.

After crossing near Greyguard and circling south-east through the Gift, Jon Snow, a supposed defector assigned to Styr's raiding party, escapes at Queenscrown. Jon warns Mole's Town and Castle Black of the on-coming attack from the south. Many residents of Mole's Town flee to the castle, all of them helping prepare for the assault in some way. Donal Noye and Jon organize the defense around archers in the towers and a line of fighting men on the massive wooden staircase that zigzags up the south face of the Wall. ""Scarecrow sentinels"", dummy soldiers in Night's Watch black, are posted at roofs and windows to inflate their numbers. The battle begins in the early morning hours as wildling raiders and Thenn warriors storm Castle Black. Although the archers take a heavy toll on the wildling force (Jon Snow and Satin pouring boiling oil on Thenns who try to take their tower), the defenders at the gate through the Wall are overwhelmed when the Mole's Town men break and flee. The battle culminates on the stair as Styr attacks upward before trying to breach the gate. Once the majority of the wildling forces mount the stair and push back the crumbling defense, the Watch springs a desperate trap. The stair, soaked in oil between the last Night's Watch line of defense and the base of the structure, is set ablaze, destroying the stair and killing Styr and most of his men. Ygritte dies in Jon's arms. While the raiding party is defeated, Mance's main force has yet to be dealt with and the Watch's primary means of transporting men and materials to the top of the Wall is destroyed. With the news that his advance party has been defeated, and he must instead assault the Wall, Mance assembles his host beyond the tree line. After a small probing attack at night, the first morning's attacks are spearheaded by giants mounted on mammoths. Mag the Mighty, King of the Giants, manages to breach the massive doors that lead to the tunnel underneath the Wall. Donal Noye and several brothers defend the tunnel system with spears and arrow fire from behind the internal gate and murder-hole system built into the tunnel. While they manage to kill all of the attackers, including Mag, and hold the interior portcullis under the Wall, all the defenders are slain, including Donal, whose body is found crushed by Mag, and his sword thrust though the giant's neck. With the death of Donal Noye, Jon Snow assumes command of the defense of the Wall at the request of Maester Aemon. Over the next several days, Jon manages to throw back repeated attacks on the Wall by using catapults, archers, flaming arrows, boiling oils and finally frozen barrels of rock and ice used to destroy Mance's armored turtle. Ser Alliser Thorne, an enemy of Jon, and Lord Janos Slynt, a betrayer of Jon's father Eddard Stark, arrive along with reinforcements from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. They take Jon into custody with the knowledge, from a captured Rattleshirt who led a diversion on the eastern side of the Wall, that he had deserted and joined forces with the wildlings. Either not believing him or not caring about his orders from Qhorin Halfhand to do just that, they imprison Jon in the ice cells under the Wall. Jon is eventually sent out to the wildling camp to treat with Mance, although Alliser and Janos want Jon to assassinate the King-Beyond-the-Wall. Meanwhile, King Stannis Baratheon sails to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea with a host of over 1,000 mounted soldiers. Accompanied by Cotter Pyke and his rangers from Eastwatch, they travel along ranger roads beyond the Wall. They take Mance Rayder's host in the flank as it besieges Castle Black. Mance's scouts warn him of the approaching rangers and as they emerge from the fringes of the wood, his free folk fly to meet them. The rangers are only scouts, a screen intended to draw in the wildlings, and they scatter back into the trees before Mance's wildlings and Harma Dogshead's raiders can slaughter them. At this crucial point, Melisandre destroys Orell's eagle that Varamyr Sixskins uses for scouting. The trumpets blow all around and three columns of heavy horse emerge. One smashes into Harma's raiders, who have no time to regroup and meet them, while the second drives into the flanks of Tormund Giantsbane's spearmen. The third is shattered by the giants on their mammoths, but the other two are able to close in around them like pincers. On the eastern edge of the camps, archers loosen fire arrows at the tents and camps of the wildlings. The wildling host breaks and runs as more men emerge from the trees. In the ensuing battle, Harma Dogshead is slain and the entire wildling force is either captured or routed with over a thousand wildlings killed. Mance is captured and most of his lieutenants are killed or captured, with the exception of Tormund Giantsbane and Varamyr Sixskins."

The Ryswells and Dustins surprise and burn the remaining longships of the Iron Fleet in the Fever River. Ramsay Bolton gathers a large force of northerners, including Boltons, Hornwoods, and Cerwyns, as well three hundred Umber spearmen and a hundred archers led by Hother Whoresbane. Ramsay's force is to rendezvous with the Ryswells and Dustins and then take the fortress.[9] After Ramsay arrives, one of Lord Rodrik Ryswell's sons, Roger or Rickard, states the ironborn have withstood three northern attacks already. Ramsay sends his servant ""Reek"", actually the traumatized Theon Greyjoy, to the castle ""disguised"" as Theon, the son of Lord Balon Greyjoy and the garrison's prince. Theon is to offer the garrison terms of surrender: if the ironborn lay down their weapons and come to the Bolton camp unarmed, Ramsay will feed them and send them home to the Iron Islands. Theon is nearly struck by a crannogmen's arrow while traveling to the ruins; blood-blooms flourish among nearby corpses. Once inside Moat Cailin, Theon discovers the garrison has been weakened by poisoned arrows and contaminated water. The cellar's vaults have flooded, so corpses are now left where they fall. All of the ironborn within the Children's Tower have died, save two cannibals eating the corpses, who were then executed by Dagon Codd. The nominal commander of the garrison, Ralf Kenning, is now incapacitated and near death on part of a poisoned arrow. Theon puts him out of his misery by slitting his throat before offering his terms to the leaderless remaining ironborn, many of whom are from the ill-regarded House Codd.  Ramsay has the surrendering ironborn flayed and displayed on pikes. Dagon Codd is opposed to the plan and distrusts the Boltons. However, he is killed with an axe to the head by Adrack Humble, who is then convinced by Theon to accept the terms on behalf of the other soldiers. Theon learns there are a mere 65 ironborn left—18 at the Drunkard's Tower and 47 at the Gatehouse Tower—and only 58 of them are combat capable. The fortress is defensible enough that the defenders could have inflicted three to one casualties on the attackers if Ramsay tried to take the position by storm, however. The 58 able-bodied men carry out five who cannot walk, while leaving two who are near death to die, as there is no hope for them. They follow the directions and lay down their weapons before the Bolton forces. Before allowing them to travel to the Stony Shore to seek transport, however, Ramsay reneges on the deal and has all 63 of the remaining ironborn flayed alive. He then puts their still-bleeding bodies upon pikes along the causeway"

However, Saltpans is not an important port and no ship is available at the time. The outlaws turn their outrage against the townfolk and begin raiding Saltpans, burning all buildings and slaughtering the people they came across. The helpless smallfolk seek refuge in the town's holdfast, but Ser Quincy Cox, the elderly Knight of Saltpans, who is apparently afraid for his own family's safety, refuses to let them in and leaves them to their fate. The outlaws rape and mutilate, and target violence against all, including old Septon Bennet and children in the arms of their mothers. When they finished their work, the outlaws headed west again, with Rorge reportedly laughing loud about his men's deeds. The atrocities are watched by a few helpless fishermen from the town, who were on their boats. After the outlaws leave and the fires had burned down, they went ashore, but all that is left for them is to bury family members and neighbors. They gathered the few survivors and brought them to the Quiet Isle, where the Elder Brother takes care of them. Witnesses describe Rorge wearing the Hound's helmet and roaring savagely as he led the monstrosities. Biter crushed his victims with his weight and—as he often does—tore flesh out of them with his sharpened teeth. A witness states a woman had been raped a dozen times, before she was given to Biter, who ripped her breasts apart with his teeth. Still, her curses while she lay dying on the Quiet Isle were reserved for Ser Quincy for keeping the gates to his holdfast closed. Another survivor is Brother Clement, a member of the order who had gone to Saltpans to sell the renowned mead brewed on the Quiet Isle. Rorge had his tongue ripped out when he refused to break his vow of silence, declaring that Clement had apparently no need of it anyway. Clement also eventually dies of the wounds. Some other brothers from the Quiet Isle are wounded or otherwise traumatized as well. Rorge raped a twelve-year-old girl promised to the Faith, crushing the girl's flesh with his armor as he lay on her, then had given her to his men who cut her nose and nipples off. The girl survived to tell her story, as did some boys who had managed to hide in time. The fishermen and others who escaped the assault eventually abandon the town, with most of them going to Maidenpool, leaving nothing behind in Saltpans than the holdfast.

Sybelle Glover and Deepwood's maester fail to convince Asha to surrender. Seeing she is outnumbered, Asha decides to retreat back to her longships under cover of darkness. As Stannis's men attack the north gate with a battering ram, the Greyjoys escape out the south gate on foot and on horse and venture into the wolfswood. Initially traveling south and southwest, the ironborn then head west and intend to travel north to their beached longships only once the sun comes up. They march all night and light no fires and cover, they think, good ground. However, the retreat is slowed due to the unfamiliar territory and darkness. The northmen by comparison know the wolfswood well and are not hindered in the same way. The northmen sneak up on the ironborn, slaying their sentries and closing in around them. The ironborn fight back fiercely, but they are surrounded and outnumbered. Eventually, they are all subdued. Asha is defeated by Morgan Liddle, while Quenton and Dagon the Drunkard, distant Greyjoy cousins, are both slain. Meanwhile, fighters in fishing sloops led by Alysane Mormont are able to sneak up on the longships off the strand, capturing or burning them.

Paxter has his men encamp before the walls of the castle of Dragonstone. He intends to take the castle bloodlessly by either starving the defenders out or creating a breach in the walls through mining and forcing the defenders to surrender. With the development of ironmen raiding the Reach after the taking of the Shields, there is more pressure on the besiegers to end the conflict quickly to free up the Redwyne fleet. Ser Loras Tyrell of the Kingsguard successfully asks Cersei Lannister for the command, as he believes Lord Paxter is taking too long. Cersei agrees, hoping that Loras will die in the battle. Lord Aurane Waters reports to Cersei in King's Landing that when Loras arrived at Dragonstone he offered single combat to the defending commander, Ser Rolland Storm, who declined. Loras stormed the castle, leading the attack himself. Once the gate was breached Stannis's defenders retreated back to the keep, which was then assaulted by the besiegers straight away. In this attack, Loras was grievously injured by a mace blow, an arrow, a crossbow bolt, and boiling oil, but eventually the keep fell. However, Aurane claims that the assault was an unnecessary bloodbath in which almost a thousand men were killed, mostly those loyal to Tommen, as a result of Loras's attempt to end the siege as quickly as possible. Many among the dead were young lords and knights.

While there are skirmishes at the start of the siege, it develops into a stalemate. Jonos lacks siege towers, battering rams, and catapults, preferring instead to starve out Tytos. After resolving the siege of Riverrun, Ser Jaime Lannister is asked by Lord Karyl Vance to assist in the resolution of the siege of Raventree, as Tytos will never yield to Jonos. Ser Daven Lannister advises Jaime to bring the siege equipment at Riverrun to Raventree, but Jaime is confident he can resolve the conflict personally and has the equipment put to the torch. When Jaime arrives in Blackwood Vale, he notices ruined fields and buildings, the result of his father Tywin's campaign. Discipline is low in the besiegers' camp; the sentries do not sound an alarm to inform of Jaime's arrival, and Jame finds Lord Jonos copulating with a common woman, Hildy. Jonos believe Tytos will surrender before the next full moon, stating the Blackwoods have only rats and roots left to eat. Jaime meets with Lord Tytos in his solar to discuss terms. Jaime's arrival allows the Blackwoods to surrender to King Tommen I Baratheon, rather than the Brackens. Lord Blackwood forfeits Buckle, Woodhedge, Honeytree, Crossbow Ridge, and Lord's Mill, which is less than what Lord Bracken desired. Jaime also takes one of Tytos's sons, Hoster Blackwood, as a hostage, and he orders Jonos to send one of his daughters to King's Landing to attend Queen regent Cersei Lannister."
